### _mikel evins <mikel@evins.net>_

A simple tool for associating a v4 UUID with an arbitrary combination
of device and user account. nodeid reads a v4 UUID from a file on the
XDG standard configuration path on Linux, macOS, or Windows.. If the
file is missing, nodeid generates and saves the ID before returning
it.
